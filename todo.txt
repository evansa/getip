==========TODO=============
Here is a list of improvements to this simple script.

1. Remove the dependency for displaying table which currently uses texttable - this should have no dependencies at all
2. Print/output in colour to the terminal
3. Add more that a single domain lookup
4. Create a setup script for local installation
5. Write the help function with usage information... and improve the README.md file.
